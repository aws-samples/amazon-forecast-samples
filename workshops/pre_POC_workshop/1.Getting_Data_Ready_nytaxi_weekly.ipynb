    "\n",
    "<b>Step 2 Make forecast choices</b>. You need to make some decisions.  How many time units in future do you want to make forecasts?  E.g. if time unit is Hour, then if you want to forecast out 1 week that would be 24*7 = 168 hours.  You'll also be asked if you want integer or float target_values.  And if 0's really mean 0 or are they missing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Step 10 Aggregate based on the time granularity of your data.</b> Possible aggregations are minute, hour, day, week, month.  See <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html#howitworks-data-alignment\" target=\"_blank\">documenatation. </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Step 12 Visualization time series and validate the time granularity you chose makes sense.</b>  Too low-granularity means the time series looks like white noise and the data could benefit by aggregation at higher-time-level.  For example, you might start to notice time series cyclical patterns when aggregating historical sales by-hour instead of of by-minute.  Alternate between Step 7 Visualization and Step 5 Aggregation until you are happy with the chosen time-grandularity for your forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Steps 10 (Aggregate) and 13 (Split train) include a set of common checks on your data for forecasting.</b> One common mistake is customers think they should \"try Amazon Forecast with a small sample of data\".  If the majority of your time series have fewer than 300 data points, Amazon Forecast will fail, because Amazon Forecast is designed for deep-learning AI forecasting algorithms, which require many data points (typically 1000+) per time series.  Small data is better off using traditional, open-source forecast methods such as ETS (available in Excel), ARIMA, or Prophet.  Small data is not a good fit for Amazon Forecast.

Suggested algorithm: <b>Traditional statistical such as Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, or ARIMA.</b></li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Intermittent demand</b> (ADI >= 1.32 and CV² < 0.49). The demand history shows very little variation in demand quantity but a high variation in the interval between two demands.
